The project uses GitHub Actions for automatic Supabase deployment when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## How can I deploy this project?

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

**Automatic Deployment**

The project automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The deployment workflow:

1. Builds the project using `npm run build`
2. Deploys the built files to GitHub Pages
3. Serves the site at the custom domain: **profiles.jobbyist.africa**

**Manual Deployment**

You can also trigger a manual deployment:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" and select the `main` branch

**GitHub Pages Configuration**

To enable GitHub Pages for this repository:

1. Go to Settings → Pages in the GitHub repository
2. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
3. Configure your DNS provider to point **profiles.jobbyist.africa** to GitHub Pages:
   - Add a CNAME record pointing to `<username>.github.io`
   - Or add A records pointing to GitHub Pages IP addresses (see [GitHub Pages custom domain docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site))

Alternatively, you can also deploy via [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/ca7da371-b69b-4a00-b0d2-ef38af1e2378) by clicking Share → Publish.

## Can I connect a custom domain to my Lovable project?

Yes, you can!

**For GitHub Pages (Current Setup)**

This project is configured to use the custom domain **profiles.jobbyist.africa**. The domain is set via the `CNAME` file in the `public/` directory.

To use your own custom domain:
1. Update `public/CNAME` with your domain name
2. Configure your DNS provider to point to GitHub Pages (see deployment section above)
3. Push your changes to the `main` branch
4. Wait for GitHub Actions to deploy

**For Lovable**

To connect a domain via Lovable, navigate to Project > Settings > Domains and click Connect Domain.
